### how has the modern web hosting changed:
  - Simon - 90s static pages, now scalability and complexity. way more traffic, so much more personalized and richer; building websites couldnt find a modern CDNs to deal with dynamically generated content. so they built it.
  - Kyle - raising expectations, inet getting bigger and bigger - can get 10M people traffic overnight - also quality of the websites; early 2010s rich websites; how much better websites are than 10years ago; all competing for attention; competition for millions of websites; fron-end webpack, js, css, react, vue - emerged out of pressure to get better; at gatsby to get better and deal w complexity;
  - Michael - as hosting provider - hughe change into using more and more services - 10y ago 1 framework tool chosen by team; like php; ovewr last year now way more pieces, devs and teams rapid inQueuse graphQI, as a hosting company quiet the change. need different php, different node versions. allow them to test them locally - test it - all inside of containers - depoly it and compare the different ways - try new things out - all inside the containers - way more flexible - playing and trying - not as rigid as it ued to be;

 ### how can modern web technologies help customers achieve their goals
  - Kyle - tools are a lot better; expectations are much greater, too; backbone js; then react would solve problems w backbone immediately on 3 different issues react; - solve things w CDNs - container based technology; you can pick the best tools for the job and piece thing stogether; gatsby - hook things together - 1000s of individuals working on advancements; choice of tools - so much choice out there - how do we deal with all these choices;
  - Michael - a lot of times customers really dont know their goals - Australian government - an email for every single citizen - told us 50min before - we could have not survived this - with containers we can scale within minutes - how many people do you expect (10x easily exceeded their own estimates) - flexible system that can scale automatically. not just hosting but also CDN side - 15minute window to respond; helping you meet your goals even if you dont know what they are;
  - Simon - predictability, scale - reddit hug of death 100,000 s of pings a second on $5 shared hosting - a band, a tv show, a superbowl app, go viral - UK government, drivers licenses, malicious - DDoS - the scale of stuff people have to deal with - and so much more complex; shopping carts, user stuff, dynamic and static content; so much you have to do just to get started- size and scale are so much more than 10, 20 years ago;

### much more complex now - how do you see modern technology simplifying the modern tech stack
  - Michael - it used to be easier in the past - just write some html and css and add some snippetts; but now they have to be useable, performance- requirements are way different - just how it is today - couldnt have done that back then - we all drive a car but we do not know how to build a car - just use the examples - we as a company write examples + documentation - USE THEM and use the documentation - lots of people and manhours that go into developing these;
  - Simon - cambrian explosion - this complex this day - a lot of companies out there try to contain that complexity - running containiers is kinda scary - but if you have a company do that for you - gatsby can run your site - fastly can provide the content all around the world - democratization of the web - people from everywhere in the chat channel
  - Kyle - how do you see technology help modernize - this is the pattern of technology - early cars have an engineer with you so he can fix it - in the early 70s for everyone to have a computer seemed crazy - apple + ibm pc - - we all do incredibly powerful stuff without engineering or tech degree - gatsby you dont have to setup babbel to use react - tools right out of the box - take a way setup time - and you can ship sth you are proud of - new technology emerges and then come in new tools to make it more accessible - what you can do today - the bar to get a lot of attention is much higher today - what takes you days you can build now was simply un imagibnable 10 20 years ago. very rare events nowadays for a service to go down (like fastly);

### how is JAMstack desgned to optimize sites and apps to utilize cloud hosting
  - Kyle - cloud native architecture - everyone setting up their own server and software - emerged in last 10 years cloud technology - fastly a way to serve files quickly anywhere in the world - lambda - run a js function anytime you want -a big shift across the industry - old style software doesnt take advantage of these advantages
  jamstack access to really nice CDNs how can we use that - no security, scale, speed problems - build you r site - deploy it - GATSBY designed for this - gatsby lets you really show your page your own way - cant hack a static pile - no security issues - little cesars - rebuild their website - ran a superbowl ad - load testing and didnt have to worry about it (traffic increase)
  - Simon - incrementalizm - satrt with a simple container and then scale it - we are caching it for you the content so we can protect you from DDods - payrolls, cookies stepo by step away from your own site - data centrer in Europe and the US - start simple and gain more and more complexity - 4 users now - I might get a superbowl ad - starting smnall and gradually increase it
  - Michael - using containers - makes things a lot easier - hosting stuff on the cloud used to be really hard - containers can die anytime - yetr with JAMstack it is really easier - makes it easier for everybody - its built into the package of the frame work _LOOK INTO THE JAMSTCK !!!!

### democratization of the web - what does it mean and what does it mean for the web
  - Simon - it seems the access has been narrowed in the last 10 years - let everyone have access and let the whole world be better for that
  - Michael - trying to support as many infrastructure providers as possible - as many platforms as possible - write documentation and test it - make sur it is completely open source - we dont run our own lagoon fork - we run the one that is publicly available - it d like to see it more
  - Kyle - makeing building stuff accessible - gatsby - only learned to program in college - mysquel - fascinating, rewarding, deploy a website - the ability to create and share what you create - very fulfilling - create businesses around it - needs to continue to be a great technology place - part of the internet is not such a friendly place anymore (shocked to discover the first virus) now its abounds - bad actors - better services to protect ourselves; also the complexity - working in teams - meets their own expectations; great jobs and companies

### any calls to action
  - Simon - great to see so many people from around the world;
  - Kyle - questions about Gatsby - March 2nd whole day of talks and workshops; starter support
  - Michael - important to do a lot of training - container - a guiding hand - kubernetes - talk to us - free trials - take it apart and look at it - poke at it - open source - partner with CDN companies so they can offer it - run by fastly and included in hosting. standard example to make it easier to use. 

  I attended an online meetup that was called  “The future of web development & hosting: how to build performance apps for the modern web”.

1.) Danielle Flannery making the introduction and handling Q & A (fastly company- communications)

2.) Kelly Fitzpatrick - Industry analyst - RedMonk - HOST

3.) Michael Schmid - CTO & co founder amazee.io

4.) Kyle Mathews - CEO & founder Gatsby

5.) Simon Winstow - VP of strategic initiatives & Co founder Fastly

The main topic of meet up was new technologies - specifically container-based hosting - amazee.io (kubernetes based scalable dynamic hosting company) cloud services around Gatsby (complete development package - all to optimize load time, increase scalability, security and reliability) and Fastly (world wide content delivery that is dynamically hosted to go hand in hand with container based hosting) .

all really new and fascinating for me - I think I will learn  much more about this in 301 as we are going to cover the server side of the internet

they also spoke about the concept of JAMstack. It’s  is a modern architecture for building websites and applications, without requiring the use of a database or server-side programming language.

The JAM in JAMStack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.

they also spoke about their experience of increased complexity in web dev around the word - compared to 10 or 20 years ago - much higher expectations - but also much more powerful tools (you can build in a matter of 3 days what would have seemed utterly impossible 10 years ago). also not to be intimidated by it - you don't need to know how to build an entire car just to drive it.  - look at documentation and use the tools that are provided by companies (lots of hours of work go into these) 

It was also interesting to hear that all fast sites have several best practices in common and that gatsby as a company was built on that vision to make these best proactices of the fastest sites around the world available to people as a package they could use immediately
