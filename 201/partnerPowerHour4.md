was mainly a summary/tutorial for bash commands
with a little history (bash = born again shell command line)

+ pwd path working directory - tells you where you are
+ cd change directory 
+ . expands to current directory
+ .. expands to up one directory (parent)1
+ ~ expands to home directory
+ cp copy
+ rm remove
+ mv move or rename
+ touch to create a file
+ mkdir to create a directory
+ cat to print contents of a file (only for short/small files)
+ which - tells you where that command lives
+ which live-server to see where live-server lives
+ curl to make http requests
+ ls -a list all files incld hidden (-a)
+ man - manual
+ --help

my own addition
+ history displays the last 500 commands
+ cd - brings you back to last directory

### The breakdown of the REPL method was informative. It was a simplistic way of breaking down command-lines in your shell environment: 
READ a line of input
EVALUATE the input
PRINT the result
LOOP back to the first step
### STDIN (standard input system), STDOUT (the input stream), and STDERR (the two output streams)
When running a script from a text file, each line gets read and evaluated, then the next one and so on. Shells have an input stream called STDIN (standard input, or "0") and two output streams called STDOUT (standard output, or "1") and STDERR (standard error, or "2").

When running interactively, STDIN is provided by typing commands, and both STDOUT and STDERR are pointed out to the user.


## Share 1 or 2 ways the speakerâ€™s information will change your approach to your career transition.
+ become better at typing (Emily was really good at typing)
+ become better @ command prompt navigation. Also know my directories - where are the main places (working directory, saved files, command directories)


## Do you have any other key take-aways, or observations about this Partner Power Hour?
what I learned on a professional level: be yourself and be good at what you do.
