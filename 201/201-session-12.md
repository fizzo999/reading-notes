Basic usage Drawing shapes with canvas
Applying styles and colors Drawing text


### **Setting up instructions**:
1. [Download Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js)
2. Copy the _Chart.min.js_ out of the unzipped folder and into the directory
3. Create a new html page and import the script

```html
<head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
``` 

### Using Chart.
download the plugin
drawing a line chart
then ad the dimensions of the chart
declare the variable
set lables and data sets, color options
drawing a pie chart is very similar
the `<canvas>` element
looks alot like and img element at first
but it doesnt have a src and alt attributes
you can set using DOM properties 
styled like normal..
initially be fully transparent
if specifying a fallback you need a closing tag
use getContext(); to obtain rendering context and its drawing functions
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial'); var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
Drawing shapes with canvas
Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0).
All elements are placed relative to this origin
+ fillRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a filled rectangle.
+ strokeRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a rectangular outline.
+ clearRect(x, y, width, height) Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.

### **Drawing a line chart**

1. Create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. 

```html 
<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
``` 
2. Write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element.

```html
<script>
    var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>
```
3. Inside the same script tags we need to create our data

```html 
<!-- Object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart -->
<script>
var buyerData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
			pointColor : "#fff",
			pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
			data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
		}
	]
}
</script>
```  
## Canvas

the `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be **300 pixels** wide and **150 pixels** high.  

It is always a good idea to supply an `id` attribute because this makes it much easier to identify it in a script.  

The `<canvas>` element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown.  

The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. 

### Canvas / Colors  

To apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

1. `fillStyle = color`
    - Sets the style used when filling shapes.
2. `strokeStyle = color`
    - Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
```css
ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
```

### Canvas / Drawing text

The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

1. `fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])`
    - Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
2. `strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])`
    - Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

```javascript 
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.fillText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}

//text is not filled in with color, only lines
  function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}
```  



### Drawing Paths

+ beginPath() Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.

Path methods Methods to set different paths for objects.

+ closePath() Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.

+ stroke() Draws the shape by stroking its outline.

+ fill() Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

+ moveTo(x, y) Moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y.

+ lineTo(x, y) Draws a line from the current drawing position to the position specified by x and y.

+ arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise) Draws an arc which is centered at (x, y) position with radius r starting at startAngle and ending at endAngle going in the given direction indicated by anticlockwise (defaulting to clockwise).

+ arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, radius) Draws an arc with the given control points and radius, connected to the previous point by a straight line.

+ quadraticCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, x, y) Draws a quadratic Bézier curve from the current pen position to the end point specified by x and y, using the control point specified by cp1x and cp1y.

+ bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y) Draws a cubic Bézier curve from the current pen position to the end point specified by x and y, using the control points specified by (cp1x, cp1y) and (cp2x, cp2y).

+ rect(x, y, width, height) Draws a rectangle whose top-left corner is specified by (x, y) with the specified width and height.

+ Path2D() The Path2D() constructor returns a newly instantiated Path2D object, optionally with another path as an argument (creates a copy), or optionally with a string consisting of SVG path data.

### applying styles and colors

fillStyle = color Sets the style used when filling shapes.

strokeStyle = color Sets the style for shapes' outlines.

globalAlpha = transparencyValue Applies the specified transparency value to all future shapes drawn on the canvas. The value must be between 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). This value is 1.0 (fully opaque) by default.

lineWidth = value Sets the width of lines drawn in the future.

lineCap = type Sets the appearance of the ends of lines.

lineJoin = type Sets the appearance of the "corners" where lines meet.

miterLimit = value Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes.

getLineDash() Returns the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.

setLineDash(segments) Sets the current line dash pattern.

lineDashOffset = value Specifies where to start a dash array on a line.

createLinearGradient(x1, y1, x2, y2) Creates a linear gradient object with a starting point of (x1, y1) and an end point of (x2, y2).

createRadialGradient(x1, y1, r1, x2, y2, r2) Creates a radial gradient. The parameters represent two circles, one with its center at (x1, y1) and a radius of r1, and the other with its center at (x2, y2) with a radius of r2.

gradient.addColorStop(position, color) Creates a new color stop on the gradient object. The position is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 and defines the relative position of the color in the gradient, and the color argument must be a string representing a CSS , indicating the color the gradient should reach at that offset into the transition.

createPattern(image, type) Creates and returns a new canvas pattern object. image is a CanvasImageSource (that is, an HTMLImageElement, another canvas, a element, or the like. type is a string indicating how to use the image.

repeat Tiles the image in both vertical and horizontal directions.

repeat-x Tiles the image horizontally but not vertically.

repeat-y Tiles the image vertically but not horizontally.

no-repeat Doesn't tile the image. It's used only once.

shadowOffsetX = float Indicates the horizontal distance the shadow should extend from the object. This value isn't affected by the transformation matrix. The default is 0.

shadowOffsetY = float Indicates the vertical distance the shadow should extend from the object. This value isn't affected by the transformation matrix. The default is 0.

shadowBlur = float Indicates the size of the blurring effect; this value doesn't correspond to a number of pixels and is not affected by the current transformation matrix. The default value is 0.

shadowColor = color A standard CSS color value indicating the color of the shadow effect; by default, it is fully-transparent black.

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]) Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]) Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly. A great way to get started with charts is with **Chart.js**, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more,
