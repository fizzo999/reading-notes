#### Introduction (pp.2-11)
Read Summary pages in blue; then find the black pages and study them; then study the code and the examples; focus on understanding the concepts; 

#### HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages; tags (elements) act like containers; they tell us sth about what lies between opening and end tag; `<p>text</p>`;

tags `<p attributes Name(lang) and Value(="en-us")>`; attributes tell us more about the element; they have a name and a value;

#### HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)
+ starts with !DOCTYPE - ref basic structure - html (head, body(header(nav),main(section, article, aside),footer));
+ comments `<!--comment here-->` ignored by interpreter;
+ id (only 1 per page) and class (multiple times per page) attributes for element tags;
+ block elements take up all the space (per line) they can and cause a line break after;
+ inline elements snuggle up to before and after;
+ div tags group text and elements in a block;
+ span tags group text and elements inline;
+ iframes create a window in a window (think google maps);
+ meta tags add meta data - not displayed (think search optim, keywords, robots; description that shows up in tab ontop);
+ escape characters (think `&copy; &lt; &gt;` )

#### HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)

+ wireframes - a simple sketch of the key info that needs 2go on each page;
+ design is about communication;
+ visual hierarchy helps visitors 2 understand what u r trying 2 tell them;
