# What is a command terminal ?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:

**`user@bash$`**  ls -l /home/ryan
total 3
+ drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
+ drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
+ drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
