# Chosing a text editor

## What is a text editor?


A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are:

1. code completion; 
2. syntax highlighting; 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the
closing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure
you’re always writing your code.

Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.

Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.


### Built in Text editors like Notepad,..
Usually, the text editors that come on your
computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest
bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites,
there are other text editors available that might help you code more
efficiently

# What is a command terminal ?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:

1. **`user@bash$`**  ls -l /home/ryan
1. total 3
1. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
1. drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
1. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
1. **`user@bash$`**

+ Line 1 presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).

+ Lines 2 - 5 are output from running the command. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.

+ Line 6 presents us with a prompt again. After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command the prompt will be displayed. If no prompt is displayed then the command may still be running (you will learn later how to deal with this).
Your terminal probably won't have line numbers on it. I have just included them here to make it easier to refer to different parts of the material.

## more commands

### pwd
