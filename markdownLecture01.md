I will write my notes here 2 paragraphs
what I learned was about putting an image inside of markdown....
it first would not show up, except as a link

then I tried to upload it to github and struggled to find the correct file path

# this is an H1
## this is an H2
### this is an H3

ul
* Item One
* Item Two
* Item 3

ol
1. Item One
1. Item Two
1. Item Three

it automatically orderes the list
