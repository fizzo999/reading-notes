## Grid CSS 

CSS Grid Layout is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.  

### Terminology 

1. Grid Container
    - The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.

2. Grid Item
    - The children of the grid container.

3. Grid Line
    - The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be vertical or horizontal.

4. Grid Cell
    - The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single “unit” of the grid.

5. Grid Track
    - The space between two adjacent grid lines.  

## Regex

A regular expression - shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

RegEx allows us to check for patterns in text strings such as trying to match a valid email address or password. One of the great superpowers of RegEx is being able to define your own search criteria for a pattern to fit your needs, and it is like a language of its own.
