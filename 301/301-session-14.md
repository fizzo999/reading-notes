The forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form. Before we discuss the various forms and rules in detail, let’s summarize the various forms:
  - First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

# Project Ideas
What ideas do you have for projects? What would your model be that you can control and update the view with? What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?

[Take a look at this repo for inspiration about APIs you could use.](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

For those of you who were in 201, be sure to look back at the project discussion assignment from that course and see if there is anything from there that was not done that could be carried forward as an idea for this class.
