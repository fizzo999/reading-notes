## Webscraping for node.js and puppeteer

very interesting presentation. How to scrape data off of webpages. Setup with puppetteer uses server and packages style setup that we know from 301. New are the use of asynch functions.
Careful with asking permission first as you scrape from the web - legal issues.
the data that you select (go into dev tools and look at #id's) and run through the process
what comes back can be an ugly object that needs some work to reformat (Chance did a great job at that)
and once you do it to one set of data you can automate the process

career learning from it - it's a tool - and it shows again that STYLING is IMPORTANT - even with data scraped off of other pages.
