# What specific contributions did you make? Please share links to your Pull Requests (or commits) even if they haven't been merged.

I setup the user_data page and rough drafted the other_users_data and track_data pages

I also added the about us page - I made the flip cards work - added all the social links (github and linkedIn) for all 4 team members and downloaded the 4 slack user profile images.

In the evening I went back (as a treat to myself) and played some more CSS. I found a cool neon purple github image and merged it in photoshop with the standard black outline kitty symbol from github - and I added a glow effect when you hove over the social icons - that was fun.

still working through some git issues - James has walked me several times though merge issues. I am not used to using VSCode for the git process but I can see what a powerful tool that is.

I also had help from James (he has been our personal TA) for about 30min just trouble shooting why the app would not work for me - when it did for them - my user experience is different - I have never used Spotify (like ing songs and stuff) so a lot of values came back undefined. James was a great sport about it. He insisted that its a good way to polish our app and a great learning for everyone. I agree. I am thankful

This evening I realized that this is what Nicholas and others were talking about. Being willing to feel uncomfortable. Like one day I figure something out or finish a project and I feel amazing. And then I stumble into the next project hurdle that sometimes takes me all the way to the bottom of feeling like an idiot. Until I work through that and feel great/amazing/confident again.

I want to learn to see my journey more distanced and objectively/unemotionally. I make up my mind to be less influenced by that sucky victim feeling of not knowing. I do know. And I know how to get answers/help. And if I really hit a dead end - that's ok, too. There is always a way and an answer. All problems and all solutions already exist in the mind of God. Remember, Fizzo, a light heart.
