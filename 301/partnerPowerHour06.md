## Unlearn Imposter Syndrome

### Imposter syndrome - Definition

A psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their achievements and believe that they are not as competent as other think. (I would add that that harkens back to a deeper root of feeling unworthy and not good enough - which is a lack of self love that one can cure themselves - and with help from outside. Selflove is the key to healing)

70% of people experience imposter syndrome at some point in their lives ("Valerie Young")

4 main types of imposter syndrome:
+ Perfectionist - I m not good enough because I cant deliver 100% quality 100% of the time
+ Natural Genius - I m not good enough because I can't do things right away and with ease.
+ Soloist - I m not good enough if I can't accomplish everything on my own.
+ Expert - I m not good enough if I don't know all there is to know about my topic.

## What to do about it

1. break the silence
1. separate feelings from facts
1. recognize your expertise and abilities
1. develop a new response to failure - keep it light - see it in the light of all eternity - remember life loves you
1. visualize success
1. take baby steps and celebrate baby step accomplishments
1. focus on others (help someone else) and focus on providing value
1. reward yourself (preferably not goods but experiences - in nature,...)
1. FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT
1. I d add remember to relax your shoulders and breath,...
1. remember life loves you - just as you are
1. remember you dont have to earn love - you are loved
1. remember to make a gratitude journal entry every night - even if its just for 3minutes - relect on what you are grateful for
1. tell yourself that you are awesome
