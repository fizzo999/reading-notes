I liked the first speaker the most - Nadia Bahrami. She studied at Codefellows. I have reached out on LinkedIn.
Her recommendations to find the role/job that I am looking for:

- which companies am I interested in -
  - go to their career site
  - follow them on twitter/reach out on LinkedIn
- find opportunities:
  - Indeed, Glassdoor searches
  - LinkedIn - networking
  - Meetups - topic specific

She stressed the IMPORTANCE of practice - behavioral interview questions/answers.

Behavioral Questions:

- have a set answer - practice !
- embrace your backstory
- always have a solution - don`t end on negative
- be concise
- be confident
- always have at least one question for them

The technical Interview:

- define the environment
- write your test cases
- pseudo-code
- get the solution
- refactor/optimize

! be communicative throughout the process - if you need quiet time to think - that's ok - just tell them - then come back and keep talking - stay engaged - so the interviewers know that you are working on it and not just stalled.

very informative. Lots of tips. Studied at Codefellows (Alumni) - sent LinkedIn invitation.
