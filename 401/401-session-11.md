# Readings Class 11: Event Driven Applications

#### Why is access control important?
It is authentication and identity verfication! it controls who can access routes and make changes to an application
#### Describe an application that would need access control.
access to restricted data, restricting CRUD actions (only allowed to read and post but NOT delete,..)
#### What is a role used for?
managing access levels (pair with capabilities)
#### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
RBAC takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role. [techopedia](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Mandatory,_Discretionary,_Role_and_Rule_Based_Access_Control)
