# Reading Class 26: Component Based UI

### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

- AngularJS
- VueJS
- BackboneJS
- NodeJS
- EmberJS
- MeteorJS
- PolymerJS
- Aurelia
- Svelte
- Bootstrap

### What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

a framework forces architectual adjustment by the developer. A library gives the choice of methods to use but leaves the architecture wide open.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### Rendering

[quora](https://www.quora.com/What-does-rendering-mean-in-computer-science-and-why-is-this-word-used-to-describe-what-it-means)
the creation of a visual representation of data.

### Templates

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system)
A web template system in web publishing lets web designers and developers work with web templates to automatically generate custom web pages, such as the results from a search. This reuses static web page elements while defining dynamic elements based on web request parameters. Web templates support static content, providing basic structure and appearance. Developers can implement templates from content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.
Template (file format), a standardized non-executable file type used by computer software as a pre-formatted example on which to base other files, especially documents.

### State

[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-state-react/)
State in React is a plain JavaScript object. It holds information that influences the output of render and is managed within the component. The state starts with a default value when a Component mounts and then suffers from mutations in time (mostly generated from user events). It's a serializable\* representation of one point in time—a snapshot.
